just as the title says

Not working rn, error when looping to next player

# HOW TO USE

Install and change the settings in the .env to your discord group, the specific channel, and id
> If you don't now how to get the id, look up how to make a discord bot.

Put it on your local device ( i don't have a server running rn, servers cost mony :C )
and run. 

When everything works, the bot will say hi, and the bot can be used

# How do I get it to do anything?

`!start`

all instructions after that are made clear.
